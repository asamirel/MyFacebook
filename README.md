# MyFacebook
It is my first individual php project from scratch.

I made it look like facebook in just the home page cuz i like fb :).

Features done : login, logout, post, comment.

Features will be done later : 

    - Messaging : (easy anyway just messaging table in Database (mssg_id, sender_mail, receiver_mail, mssg_text), 
                then create a button in user profile page for ex. and when clicks on it text area appears, write in it your message, 
                press send).

    - Chat Groups, Groups,...
    
Hint : this project this way in php is subject to sql injection, better use prepared statements.

--feel free to edit it as you like :). *it is for learning and fun only.
